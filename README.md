Phase 2: Feasibility Plan

Welcome to Phase 2 of the course project: the Feasibility Plan. In this phase, your group will submit a more detailed plan for your project. 
You will answer questions about your project (based on the Week 4 Phase 1 Checklist and the Claim Your Data and Idea template). 
You will also submit your DTA and DO files for your proposed idea. All questions below must be completed in order for us to consider your Feasibility Plan submitted.
We will not grade your group's submission (i.e., it will be an automatic zero) unless Crowdmark responses and required replication files are submitted by the deadline.

Group Submission:

This is a group submission. To submit, you must first make your paired group below, and then one person can submit the group responses to the questions. 
Note: in order for both group members to receive grades you must submit as a group.

Checklist Questions:

Please answer the questions below regarding your group's idea and dataset, which expand on the feasibility checklist we saw in Week 4 of the course. 
I provide exemplar answers using cases we've seen in the course lecture slides (e.g., income and democracy example, CPS data example, and the California test score example). 
I particularly use the California test score example because you are intimately familiar with this setting, and you are able to refer to the textbook for more information. 
The aim is use this familiarity to try to translate this schema to your own idea/dataset.

Replication Files to Submit:

Following the culture in economics for transparency in empirical analysis, we require replication documentation for your group's analysis. 
In this stage, we are asking for the results of a simple linear regression of the a main Y and a main X for your idea in Crowdmark. 
We need you to submit the support files for this simple linear regression such that the following Stata code will run:


Except in your case you would use the names of Y and X in your group's dataset and you would clean and use your own dataset. 
More explicitly, this means you would change testscr to the name of your chosen Y variable, you would change str to the name of your chosen X variable and you would 
load your own dataset(s) into data/raw and call it instead of caschool.dta. This means you need to submit support files as described below.

Description of Files

1. Submit your Stata data file (Stata DTA file)

See the example code above
If you create new variables or manipulate your data from a source dataset (or datasets) this means you will upload the source data and create those variables 
and do those manipulations first, in the section where is says "* (If you need to modify the data, you can do that here.)"
We will be looking primarily at your script file submitted as above for this submission. However, at the end of the project we will expect 
completely replicable script files (e.g., that clean/create the analysis data and run the analysis reproducing your project's results). 
These will be submitted to us on Dec 5th as part of your replication package. All analysis should be run in Stata.
2. Submit your code file (Stata DO file)

See the example code above
This will be a DO file which (in the least) calls the Stata analysis data file and runs a simple linear regression of your chosen Y and chosen X 
(i.e., the same regression that is described by your group in Crowdmark) and creates a basic scatter plot of Y against X.
Final Checks

It is worth double checking the following:
Your group has met the requirements for submitted files
After submitting, your group has verified that everything has been submitted properly.
