Q10 You will be given a chance to describe the data type further in the questions following this one. See Week 1-2 Lecture slides for more information on data structures.
    - cross-sectional 

Q11) Unit of observation in your data
    - Unit of observation is country

Q12_A) Base article(s) for your project
The base article is an article that most relates to your idea. You don't necessarily need to use the exact same data as this article (although you can), 
but you should have an article that most informs your analysis and regression specifications. This assures that your regression specifications are anchored in 
the existing economic theory in your area. One way to think about it: the base article is the one article that would be the most important to include in your literature review. If it makes sense that there is more than one article, please post with brief explanation.

Q14) Is your data sourced direct from data provider Is any part of your data directly sourced from a data provider?
    - Multiple data points sourced / web scraped by you directly from one or more data providers

Q15) If data is sourced direct from provider, provide a description. If your data sourced wholly or partly from a data provider: - # NOT DONE
    - The Human Development Index quantifies a countries overall development in three key dimensions: life expectancy (health), education (mean and expected years of schooling) and standard of living (GNI per capita). The HDI scores every country with a composite score between 0 to 1, where higher scores indicate higher development. 
    - The Global Crypto Adoption Index ranks countries by their grassroots cryptocurrency usage by everyday users rather than large instituational trades. Based on four individual metrics, including dimensions of trading volume, a score between 1 (highest) to 0 (lowest) is assigned to every country. 

Q17) Run a regression of Y on X in your group’s dataset and note the sample size in this regression. Report this number below. Include only the numerical value 
    - 130

Q18) Run a regression of Y on X in your group’s dataset and note the estimated slope coefficient and standard error. Use as many decimal places as you think warranted.
    - In a regression of cryptocurrency adoption score on education index that is robust to standard error, the slope coefficient is 0.152 with a standard error of 0.06049. 

Q20) In your regression of Y on X interpret the estimated slope coefficient.
    - The estimated slope coefficient of 0.152 means that a 1-unit increase in a country's education score is associated with a 0.152-point increase in that country's cryptocurrency adoption score, which is measured on a scale from 0 to 1, on average. Alternatively, in terms of standard deviations, a 1 standard deviation increase in a country's education index (where the standard deviation of Edu_score is 0.215) is associated with a 0.033-point increase (0.152 * 0.215) in the cryptocurrency adoption score, measured on the same 0 to 1 scale, on average.

Q21) Statistical Significance: In your regression of Y on X in your group’s dataset, is the slope coefficient is statistically significant at the 5% significance level. - Yes the t-stat is 0.013 ie, significant at the 5% level.

Q22) Statistical Precision: In your regression of Y on X in your group’s dataset, discuss whether the slope coefficient is statistically significant by referring to the  p-value and a 95% confidence interval. Comment on whether your estimate is precise.
    - The estimated slope coefficient is statistically significant at the 5% level (0.152/0.06049=2.51>1.96) with a p-value of 0.013%. A 95% confidence interval is (.0323 , 0.2717). This estimate is relatively precise; our confidence interval is comfortably away from zero, with 0.2717 as the closest bound on the interval estimate. 

Q23) Economic Significance: In your regression of Y on X in your group’s dataset, discuss whether the slope coefficient is economically/practically significant.
    - The estimated slope coefficient of 0.152 is relatively large, as we are measuring the cryptocurrency adoption index score on a scale from 0 to 1. Therefore, a 15% increase in education score results in a sizeable increase in cryptocurrency adoption. Additionally, the standard deviation of the coefficient is 0.0605, which indicates moderate variability in the relationship between education and adoption scores across countries. The OLS regression line is given by C = 0.152 * Edu_score + 0.0386, meaning that for countries with very low education scores, the predicted cryptocurrency adoption score is approximately 0.0386. Whereas for countries that have high education scores, their cryptocurrency adoption score is 0.152 points higher, giving them a predicted score of 0.1906. This is a notable increase, especially considering the analysis only includes education as a predictor and no other national development factor. Additionally, this is considered a sizeable increase since the mean Crypt score is 0.123. To provide a more realistic explanation of this data we can interpret it in terms of of standard deviation. As mentioned previosuly a 1 standard deviation increase in the education level is associated with a 3.3% increase in the Crypt index level which is signification considering the mean is 12.3%. Education, therefore, makes a significant economic difference in cryptocurrency adoption, even when not accounting for other national developmental factors. 

Q16) Upload your results PDF from GitHub
Every time you commit a new submission in GitHub, a PDF of your results (scatter plot and regression) is automatically created. Please upload that PDF file here.

Q24) Plans moving forward. If you’ve gotten all the way to this question, this means you have an analysis dataset and you can run a simple linear regression and interpret the results. 
    This completes basic feasibility. Moving forward, what are your group’s plans for your project? Please describe these in 1 or 2 short paragraphs below.
    - Moving forward, our group plans to expand the current analysis by incorporating multiple regression techniques. Specifically, we aim to conduct a difference-in-difference (DiD) analysis to compare OECD and non-OECD member countries. This will allow us to examine whether there are statistically significant differences between these groups, particularly in how certain variables influence outcomes. By doing so, we hope to gain deeper insights into the impact of membership in the OECD on key development indicators.
