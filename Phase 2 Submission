Q10 You will be given a chance to describe the data type further in the questions following this one. See Week 1-2 Lecture slides for more information on data structures.
    - cross-sectional 

Q11) Unit of observation in your data
    - Unit of observation is country

Q12_A) Base article(s) for your project
The base article is an article that most relates to your idea. You don't necessarily need to use the exact same data as this article (although you can), 
but you should have an article that most informs your analysis and regression specifications. This assures that your regression specifications are anchored in 
the existing economic theory in your area. One way to think about it: the base article is the one article that would be the most important to include in your literature review. If it makes sense that there is more than one article, please post with brief explanation.

Q12_B) Is your data is sourced direct from a research article or book. You have sourced data for your project, which may be from an existing article(s) and/or directly sourced from data provider(s). Please indicate whether any part of your data is sourced direct from a research article?
Please indicate the response that fits best:
    - Dataset sourced from a research article but augmented with other data

Q13- # NOT DONE, Please cite Hd2019 and the global currency data set
If data is sourced from a research article or book, provide its citation and your relative contribution

If you do not source any part of your data from an existing research article or book, state: N/A

If your data sourced wholly or partly from a research article or book, please provide the reference below (this may be the same as your base article and if so, repeat the citation here). Below this citation, describe, specifically, how you will extend your analysis beyond the analysis reported in the research article.

Please provide your citation in author-date Chicago citation style. You can see the author-date Chicago citation style here (scroll to "Journal Articles").


Q14) Is your data sourced direct from data provider Is any part of your data directly sourced from a data provider?
    - Multiple data points sourced / web scraped by you directly from one or more data providers

Q15) If data is sourced direct from provider, provide a description. If your data sourced wholly or partly from a data provider: - # NOT DONE


Q17) Run a regression of Y on X in your group’s dataset and note the sample size in this regression. Report this number below. Include only the numerical value 
    - 130

Q18) Run a regression of Y on X in your group’s dataset and note the estimated slope coefficient and standard error. Use as many decimal places as you think warranted.
    - In a regression of cryptocurrency adoption score on education index, the slope coefficient is 0.152 with a standard error of 0.0729. 

Q20) In your regression of Y on X interpret the estimated slope coefficient.
    - The estimated slope coefficeint of 0.152 means that a 1 unit increase in a country's education score is asscoaited with a 0.152 point increase in a country's cryptocurrency adoption score, which is measured on a scale from 0-1, on average.

Q21) Statistical Significance: In your regression of Y on X in your group’s dataset, is the slope coefficient is statistically significant at the 5% significance level. - Yes the t-stat is 0.039 ie, significant at the 5% level.

Q22) Statistical Precision: In your regression of Y on X in your group’s dataset, discuss whether the slope coefficient is statistically significant by referring to the  p-value and a 95% confidence interval. Comment on whether your estimate is precise.
    - The estimated slope coefficient is statistically significant at the 5% level (0.152/0.0729=2.08>1.96) with a p-value of 0.039%. A 95% confidence interval is (0.0077315, 0.29629). This estimate is relatively precise; our confidence interval is comfortably away from zero, with 0.29629 as the closest bound on the interval estimate. 

Q23) Economic Significance: In your regression of Y on X in your group’s dataset, discuss whether the slope coefficient is economically/practically significant.
ex. Example answer (note: style of answer is context specific): The estimated slope coefficient of -2.28 is relatively small. For instance, the standard deviation of str in these data is 1.9, so a one standard deviation change in str would be a -4.33 difference in test scores. Meanwhile, a standard deviation in test scores is 19.1, so a 1 standard deviation difference in str is associated with only 23% of a standard deviation in test scores. In other words, a difference in class size that is large for these schools is associated with a relatively small difference in predicted test scores. Note: if you would like another example of explaining the economic significance here, look at the description in Section 4.2 (page 109) in Stock and Watson.

    - The estimated slope coefficient of 0.152 is relatively large, as we are measuring the cryptocurrency adoption index score on a scale from 0 to 1. Therefore, a 15% increase in education score results in a sizeable increase in cryptocurrency adoption. Additionally, the standard deviation of the coefficient is 0.0729, which indicates low variability in the relationship between education and adoption scores across countries. The OLS regression line is given by C = 0.152 * Edu_score + 0.0386, meaning that for countries with very low education scores, the predicted cryptocurrency adoption score is approximately 0.0386. For OECD countries, the score is 0.152 points higher, giving them a predicted score of 0.1906. This is a notable increase, especially considering the analysis only includes education as a predictor. Education, therefore, makes a significant economic difference in cryptocurrency adoption, even when not accounting for other national developmental factors. 

Q16) Upload your results PDF from GitHub
Every time you commit a new submission in GitHub, a PDF of your results (scatter plot and regression) is automatically created. Please upload that PDF file here.

Q24) Plans moving forward. If you’ve gotten all the way to this question, this means you have an analysis dataset and you can run a simple linear regression and interpret the results. 
    This completes basic feasibility. Moving forward, what are your group’s plans for your project? Please describe these in 1 or 2 short paragraphs below.
